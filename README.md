Recently, I'm a CMU graduate student major in management information systems (software engineering track). I worked as data development engineer and data scientist for the past three years. And now, I decide to be a software engineer as my next career goal. I firmly believe that an interdisciplinary talent is someone who I could be.


- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a big fan of Overwatch. Heros never die~
